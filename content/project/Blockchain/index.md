Technological developments have always made changes in all areas of our lives and crypto currency is one of these changes. Because of these changes, a lot of electronic currencies such as litecoin, ethereum, ripple, and bitcoin have evolved and found a use in business. Many people have favored bitcoin over the years among the rest. As the fundamental technology of Bitcoin, blockchain has captivated the awareness of many experts and scholars and hence become a very popular buzz word because of the tremendous 
success of Bitcoin. Many industries and industrial sectors are also exploring the potentials of 
this technology.

Blockchain refers to a distributed ledger technology, which develops into a complete storage 
system built on logic control functions like intelligent contracts. Block chain technology is built on decentralized point-to-point transmission network and uses cryptography principles and 
consensus mechanism to ensure the coherence of each node partaking in the distributed system, and to ensure the consistency, accuracy, deletion, or non-tampering of the recorded information. All these confirms the establishment of a sharing system with high efficiency, security, and privacy. In summary, Block chain technology is an eternal record of online transactions. It is a distributed tamper-proof database, shared, and maintained by many
parties.

Block chain applications cover different fields like financial services, healthcare, Internet of Things, reputation system, and many more. This report seeks to lay out an overview of Blockchain, its architecture, applications, challenges, and future trends.
