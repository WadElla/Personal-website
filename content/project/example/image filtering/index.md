title: Image Filtering
summary: This project exploits parallelism in a sequential image filtering program. The aim of this project to parallelise this program using parallel programming tools (Open MP,MPI and CUDA). This program reduced the computation time of applying sobel and blur filters on gif images by 20%. The speed up of image filtering programs is necessary it is applicable in many  sub-fields of image processing.
