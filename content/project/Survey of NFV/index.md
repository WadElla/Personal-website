Network Functions Virtualization is one of the new and different network developments that has 
been advocated in recent years. It arose as a telecom industry initiative (manufacturers, network 
operators, and carriers) to expand the flexibility of network service deployment and integration 
within operator networks. This is accomplished by the use of software modules to implement 
network tasks such as firewalls, encryption, filtering, and load balancing, among others. The idea is to avoid using devices based in specific hardware and increase return on investment. Transforming network services into software allows them to be operated on a variety of general-purpose equipment that could be located in a variety of telecom infrastructure, such as data centers, network nodes, and even end-user facilities. Virtual network functions can be easily transferred from one piece of equipment to another without the need to purchase and install specialized equipment. This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in network functions virtualization, as well as an explanation and classification of the major projects that are operating under the network functions virtualization framework.
