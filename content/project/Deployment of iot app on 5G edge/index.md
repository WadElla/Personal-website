Internet of Things (IoT) consists essentially of a system with an internet connection. Self-driving cars, smart cities, e-healthcare, and other IoT-related concepts are becoming increasingly pervasive. These applications require faster data rates, wider bandwidth, more capacity, low latency, and high throughput. The move from a static design to a dynamic, self-organizing, and developing architecture is crucial for the future IoT system. To make sure the network 
architecture is as flexible as possible, devices with very different abilities must be able to talk to each other and get access to all relevant data for their operations. The enabling infrastructure should be able to allow the connected devices to interact with the most convenient node in the network, and it should be able to optimize resource usage without compromising quality of service (QoS). The primary objective of this article is to provide a synopsis of the steps involved in the construction of an offloading framework for arbitrary IoT device tasks. The 
Internet of Things (IoT) can be used anywhere and everywhere because 5G cellular networks have the technology to make it possible. An additional contribution is the compilation of requirements, such as the requirement for Edge Computing, Offloading paradigms, and an underlying infrastructure for IoT networks and computing systems, which will be supported by Clustering, 5G mobile networking standards, and Artificial Intelligence. We conduct an experimental evaluation of edge computing and its enabling technologies using mobile gaming as a case study. In order to accomplish this, we use a resource-intensive 3D applications as a paradigmatic example and measure the response time in several deployment situations. The results of our experiments show that virtual and augmented reality applications need edge computing to meet their latency needs.
