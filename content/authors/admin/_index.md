I am Worae Daniel Adu, a master of Engineering student in Computer Science and Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests include Network and information security, Cryptography, Blockchain, Computer Networks. I am currently a graduate teaching assistant for fundamentals of cryptography at the school of computer science and engineering, UESTC.  

Before joining the Masters program at UESTC, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer engineering with first class honors at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I was among the top 10 students in my undergraduate class. 

I have years of experience working as a research and teaching assistant at both University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.

I am currently researching on Blockchain Based Recruitment Management System using Decentralized Oracle Networks.

I am an enthusiastic and dedicated professional who enjoys being part of, as well as leading, a successful and productive team. I'm quick to grasp new ideas and concepts, to develop innovative and creative solutions to problems. Again, I'm able to work very well on own initiative and can demonstrate the high levels of motivation required to meet the tightest of deadlines even under significant pressure with strong interpersonal skills. Even under significant pressure, possesses a strong ability to perform effectively.
